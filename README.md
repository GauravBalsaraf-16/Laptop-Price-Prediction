# Laptop-Price-Prediction
This dataset contains information about laptops, including brand, type, screen size, resolution, processor, RAM, storage, GPU, operating system, weight, and price. The goal is to predict laptop prices using machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, and Random Forest after performing EDA and data preprocessing. 

This repository contains an in-depth analysis and predictive modelling using a laptop dataset. The project includes:
•	Data Cleaning: Managing missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data for analysis.
•	Data Manipulation: Transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for modelling.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Unveiling insights through visualization and statistical summaries to understand key factors affecting laptop prices.
•	Machine Learning Models:
o	Implementation of various algorithms to predict laptop prices based on features like brand, specifications, and more.
o	Comparison of models to evaluate performance and identify the best algorithm.

•	Key Features of the Dataset:
o	Includes attributes such as brand, processor type, RAM, storage, screen size, and price.
Tools & Technologies
•	Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
•	Supervised learning techniques like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.

The laptop dataset consists of 12 columns, each representing a specific feature about laptops. Here's a detailed description of the features:
1.	Unnamed: 0: An index column that serves as a row identifier (can be dropped during analysis).
2.	Company: The brand or manufacturer of the laptop (e.g., Apple, HP, Dell).
3.	TypeName: The category or type of the laptop (e.g., Ultrabook, Notebook, Gaming).
4.	Inches: The screen size of the laptop measured diagonally in inches.
5.	ScreenResolution: The screen resolution of the laptop, including information like Full HD, 4K, or IPS panel.
6.	CPU: The processor details, including brand, model, and clock speed (e.g., Intel Core i5 2.3GHz).
7.	Ram: The size of the laptop's RAM, typically represented in GB (e.g., 8GB, 16GB).
8.	Memory: Storage details, including type (SSD/HDD/Flash) and capacity (e.g., 128GB SSD, 1TB HDD).
9.	Gpu: The graphics card specifications, including integrated or dedicated GPUs (e.g., Intel Iris Plus, AMD Radeon).
10.	OpSys: The operating system of the laptop (e.g., Windows, macOS, No OS).
11.	Weight: The weight of the laptop, typically in kilograms (e.g., 1.34kg, 2.5kg).
12.	Price: The price of the laptop in the given currency.

This dataset can be used for:
o	Analysing factors influencing laptop prices.
o	Understanding trends in laptop specifications and their impact on pricing.
o	Building machine learning models to predict laptop prices.
